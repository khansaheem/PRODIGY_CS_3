This project is a Password Complexity Checker that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria,
including entropy calculation, pattern detection, common password comparison,
and checking against leaked passwords using the HaveIBeenPwned API.
The tool provides feedback to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.
